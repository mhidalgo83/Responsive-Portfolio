        <p>I was born in Sierra Vista, AZ on October 23rd, 1983. As a native to southeast Arizona, the heat doesn't bother me
            too much, and I have an affinity for burritos, raspados (when I can get my hands on them), Eegee's, and other
            things that make this part of the country a truly unique to place to live.
        </p>
        <p>My goal with this bootcamp is to do a complete shift in career. Previously, I have worked in management at The Melting
            Pot, Jimmy John's, and QuikTrip. After close to 12 years working holidays, weekends, and anywhere from 50-70
            hour work weeks, I wanted to do something for myself. My hope after six months in bootcamp is to have a fresh
            start and have in demand skills.
        </p>
        <p>While I am not studying, I enjoy spending time with my family (three kids and my wife), trying different types of
            beer, listening to music, and gaming (both tabletop and electronic).</p>
